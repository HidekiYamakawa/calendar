# 📅 Calendar
A simple calendar that shows the calendar of the current year with the brazilian holidays.

🧮 The calendar logic is made by using only Javascript with its Date object. <br />
🏗 The calendar construction is also made by the Javascript manipulating the DOM. <br />
📥 The holidays are obtained with an API GET request that is on the project. <br />
🌠 And the styles are made with a little of CSS.
